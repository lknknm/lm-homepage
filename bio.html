                <br>
                <span>
                    Born in São Paulo, Brazil, Lucas Mellone has always engaged deeply
                    in creative tasks ever since he was a child. He began drawing when
                    he was only 6 years old, and continued to hone these abilities
                    until he got into the architecture school and started working as
                    an architect. “Architecture gave me a sense that we can do lots of
                    things at once. One day I can explore drawing with my own hands,
                    another day I can explore visualizing and understanding
                    complex human-to-space relationships. After trying out so many
                    things, I naturally realized I wanted to pursue music as well.”

                    In between all those years, Lucas really shared a deep love for
                    music, either by active listening or playing. He wrote, produced,
                    mixed and also painted the cover art in his newest single
                    “Aujourd'hui”, a fresh collaboration with the pianist Timothy
                    Growth:

                    “I wrote this song while still in lockdown. I feel the pandemic is something I will still be
                    talking about for a long time, mostly because I lost my father to Covid, lost contact with
                    friends and family, and the lyrics try to summarize it in a way”.

                <span>
                    This time, Mellone’s melancholic vocals talk about a past that will never come back, and many
                    possibilities that were open and hoped for the future: “I usually worry a lot about the future
                    and regret about the past. I thought we would all overcome the malice caused by the pandemic
                    with a brighter future, and this future is today. When I wrote the song I was studying French
                    and the word ‘Aujourd’hui’ stuck with me. It just means ‘today’ in english but it’s a good word
                    to summarize things I miss the most.”

                    <br></br>
                    Fusing cinematic with folktronica, ambience and acoustic elements,
                    Lucas paints a broad picture of grief, hope and in-betweens over
                    his sounds.
